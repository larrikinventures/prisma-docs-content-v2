## Use Prisma API

Every Prisma service exposes a GraphQL API with CRUD and realtime operations for the types defined in the service's data model. This API is called the **Prisma API**.

The GraphQL schema defining the types and operations of the Prisma API is referred to as the **Prisma database schema**. It is automatically generated by Prisma.
