## Install the Prisma CLI

The [Prisma CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma) is used to deploy and manage Prisma services. You can install it using NPM:

```bash
npm install -g prisma
```

## Install Docker

To use Prisma locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker yet, you can download the Docker Community Edition for your operating system [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

## Set up database and Prisma server

### Create Docker Compose file

To launch a Prisma server on your machine, you need a Docker Compose file that configures the Prisma server and specifies to which database it can connect.

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Add Prisma and database Docker images

Paste the following contents into the Docker Compose file you just created:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.11
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: mysql
            host: mysql
            port: 3306
            user: root
            password: prisma
            migrations: true
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: prisma
    volumes:
      - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  mysql:
```

### Start Prisma server and database

To start the Prisma server and launch the connected database, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Create a Prisma service

To bootstrap the configuration files for your first Prisma service, create a new directory and initalize it using the `prisma init` command:

```bash
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
prisma init --endpoint http://localhost:4466
```

## Start local Prisma server

The `prisma init` created the Docker Compose file for your Prisma server. It includes the [`prisma`](https://hub.docker.com/r/prismagraphql/prisma/) Docker image as well as the Docker image for the database you selected in the previous step.

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Deploy the Prisma service

The `prisma init` command created the _minimal_ service configuration needed to deploy a Prisma service: `prisma.yml` and `datamodel.graphql`. This service configuration now needs to be _deployed_ so you can use the Prisma API of your service:

```bash
prisma deploy
```

## Explore the Prisma API in a Playground

The Prisma API of your service exposes CRUD and realtime operations for the `User` type defined in `datamodel.graphql`. You can explore the API in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) using the following command:

```bash
prisma playground
```

Here are a few sample queries and mutations you can send to explore the API.

**Create a new `User`**:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Alice"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

> Copy the `id` of the `createUser` object returned in the Playground and use it for the `__USER_ID__` placeholer value in the upcoming `updateUser`- and `deleteUser`-mutations.

**Query all `User`s**:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

**Update a `User`'s `name`**:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: { id: "__USER_ID__" },
    data: { name: "Sarah" }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

**Delete a `User`**:

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteUser(where: {
    id: "__USER_ID__"
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
