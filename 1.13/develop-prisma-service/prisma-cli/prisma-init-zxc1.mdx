Launches an interactive CLI wizard helping you to bootstrap the service configuration for a new Prisma service. 

The generated files are:

- prisma.yml
- datamodel.graphql
- docker-compose.yml (optional)

If you provide a directory name as an argument to the command, the generated files will be placed inside a new directory with that name.

## Usage

```bash
prisma init DIRNAME
```

## Examples

**Create service configuration for Prisma service in a directory called `myapp`**

```bash
prisma init myapp
```
