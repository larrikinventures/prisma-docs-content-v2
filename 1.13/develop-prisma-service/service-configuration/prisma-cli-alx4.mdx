## Overview

The Prisma command line interface (CLI) is the primary tool to deploy and manage your Prisma services.

The Prisma CLI helps you in areas such as:

- Bootstraping service configuration files for new services
- Deploying services to Prisma _servers_
- Generating authentication tokens
- Seeding, importing and exporting data
- ...and more

## Installation

The Prisma CLI can be installed from the [NPM registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry).

### NPM

```bash
npm install -g prisma
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn global add prisma
```

## Quickstart

Once installed, execute the following commands to have your Prisma API up-and-running and start sending queries and mutations to it:

```bash
prisma init hello-world
# Select a *demo server* from the interactive prompt
cd hello-world
prisma deploy
prisma playground
```

You can now start sending queries and mutations to your Prisma API. For a more comprehensive walkthrough, check out the [Get Started](a001) section.

## Command reference

### Services

#### prisma init

Launches an interactive CLI wizard helping you to bootstrap the service configuration for a new Prisma service. 

The generated files are:

- prisma.yml
- datamodel.graphql
- docker-compose.yml (optional)

If you provide a directory name as an argument to the command, the generated files will be placed inside a new directory with that name.

##### Usage

```bash
prisma init DIRNAME
```

##### Examples

**Create service configuration for Prisma service in a directory called `myapp`:**

```bash
prisma init myapp
```

#### prisma deploy

Deploys a service configuration to a Prisma service. 

Every time you're changing a file deom your service configuration, you need to synchronize these changes with the running Prisma service.

Upon the very first deploy of a service, the command will perform initial data seeding if the `seed` property in prisma.yml is provided. You can prevent this by passing the `--no-seed` option.

If no [`endpoint`](5cy7#endpoint-optional) property is specifed in prisma.yml, the command will prompt you to interactively select a Prisma server as a deployment target for the service. After you selected a Prisma server, the CLI writes the `endpoint` into prisma.yml as the default for future deploys. To bring up the interactive prompt again, simply remove the `endpoint` property from prisma.yml manually or pass the `--new` option.

##### Usage

```bash
prisma deploy [flags]
```

##### Flags

```
-d, --dry-run              Perform a dry-run of the deployment
-e, --env-file ENV-FILE    Path to .env file to inject env vars
-f, --force                Accept data loss caused by schema changes
-j, --json                 JSON Output
-n, --new                  Force interactive mode to select the cluster
-w, --watch                Watch for changes
--no-seed                  Disable seed on initial service deploy
```

##### Examples

**Deploy service configuration in current directory:**

```bash
prisma deploy
```

**Deploy service and interactively select a Prisma server as deployment target**:

```bash
prisma deploy --new
```

**Deploy service with environment variables specified in `.env.prod`:**

```bash
prisma deploy --env-file .env.prod
```

#### prisma info

Display service information:

- Service name
- Service stage
- API endpoints (HTTP and Websocket)

##### Usage

```bash
prisma info
```

##### Flags

```
 -e, --env-file ENV-FILE    Path to .env file to inject env vars
 -j, --json                 JSON Output
 -s, --secret               Print secret in JSON output (requires --json option)
```

##### Examples

**Print information about current service:**

```bash
prisma info
```

**Print information about current service in JSON:**

```bash
prisma info --json
```

**Print information about current service in JSON and include service secret:**

```bash
prisma info --json --secret
```

> **Note**: The service secret is only printed if both the `--json` and `--secret` flags are provided.

#### prisma token

Generate a new [service token](ghd4#service-token). The service token is a [JWT](https://jwt.io) that is _signed_ with the [service secret](ghd4#service-secret).

##### Usage

```bash
prisma token [flags]
```

##### Flags

```
-c, --copy                 Copy token to clipboard
-e, --env-file ENV-FILE    Path to .env file to inject env vars
```

##### Examples

**Print service token:**

```bash
prisma token
```

**Copy service token to clipboard:**

```bash
prisma token --copy
```

#### prisma list

List all deployed services.

##### Usage

```sh
prisma list
```

##### Examples

**List all deployed services:**

```sh
prisma list
```

#### prisma delete

Delete an existing service from the Prsima its deployed to. 

This command needs to be executed inside the root directory of the Prisma service you want to delete (as the CLI requires access to prisma.yml).

##### Usage

```sh
prisma delete [flags]
```

##### Flags

```
 -e, --env-file ENV-FILE    Path to .env file to inject env vars
 -f, --force                Force delete, without confirmation
```

##### Examples

**Delete an existing service (with confirmation prompt):**

```sh
prisma delete
```

**Delete an existing service (without confirmation prompt):**

```sh
prisma delete --force
```

#### prisma introspect

Creates a [data model](knul) by _introspecting_ the schema of an existing database.


> WARNING: `prisma introspect` currently only works for Postgres databases.

The command launches an interactive wizard asking you to provide your database connection details:

- **Host**: The host of your Postgres server, e.g. `localhost`.
- **Port**: The port where your Postgres server listens, e.g. `5432`.
- **User & Password**: The credentials for your Postgres server.
- **Name of existing _database_**: The name of the Postgres _database_.
- **Use SSL (Yes/No)**: If your database connection is using SSL, you need to select `Yes`, otherwise `No`.
- **Name of existing _schema_**: The name of the Postgres _schema_, e.g. `public`.

Learn more about database introspection with Prisma [here](soi1).

##### Usage

```sh
prisma introspect
```

##### Examples

**Introspect an existing database:**

```sh
prisma introspect
```

Here is a sample interaction where the database connection details are provided through the wizard:

```
? What kind of database do you want to introspect? Postgres
? Enter database host localhost
? Enter database port 5432
? Enter database user prisma
? Enter database password ******
? Enter name of existing database prisma-db
? Enter name of existing schema public

Introspecting database 402ms
Created datamodel mapping based on 7 database tables.

Created 1 new file:               

  datamodel-[TIMESTAMP].graphql    GraphQL SDL-based datamodel (derived from existing database)
```

The generated datamodel file will contain a timestamp in its name to avoid overriding your existing datamodel.graphql file.

### Data workflows

#### prisma playground

Opens a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) for the current service. 

By default, this opens the _Desktop version_ of the Playground (if installed). The browser-based Playground can be opened by passing the `--web` flag.

###### Usage

```sh
prisma playground [flags]
```

##### Flags

```
--dotenv DOTENV          Path to .env file to inject env vars
-w, --web                Open browser-based Playground
```

##### Examples

##### Open Playground (Desktop version, if installed)

```sh
prisma playground
```

###### Open Playground (browser-based version)

```sh
prisma playground --web
```

#### prisma import

Imports data into the database of your Prisma service. 

The data needs to be formatted according to the [Normalized Data Format]().

For more info, read the [Data Import & Export]() page.

##### Usage

```sh
prisma import [flags]
```

##### Flags

```
-d, --data PATH            (required) Path to zip or directory with import data (NDF)

```sh
prisma export
```

**Export data to file called `mydata.zip`:**

```sh
prisma export --path mydata.zip
```

#### prisma seed

## Using a HTTP proxy for the CLI

The Prisma CLI supports [custom HTTP proxies](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/issues/618). This is particularly relevant when being behind a corporate firewall.

To activate the proxy, provide the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`. The behavior is very similar to how the [`npm` CLI handles this](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#https-proxy).

The following environment variables can be provided:

- `HTTP_PROXY` or `http_proxy`: Proxy URL for http traffic, for example `http://localhost:8080`
- `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy`: Proxy URL for https traffic, for example `https://localhost:8080`
- `NO_PROXY` or `no_proxy`: To disable the proxying for certain URLs, please provide a glob for `NO_PROXY`, for example `*`.

To get a simple local proxy, you can use the [`proxy` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy):

```bash
npm install -g proxy
DEBUG="*" proxy -p 8080
HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8080 HTTPS_PROXY=https://localhost:8080 prisma deploy
```
