## Develop Prisma Service

Prisma services provide a GraphQL mapping to your database. Each Prisma service exposes a GraphQL CRUD/realtime API, called the **Prisma API**. The GraphQL schema defining the operations of the Prisma API is called the **Prisma GraphQL schema**. The Prisma GraphQL schema is auto-generated based on your data model.

A Prisma service is defined by a _service configuration_ which consists of:

- A prisma.yml configuration file
- A data model written in GraphQL SDL
