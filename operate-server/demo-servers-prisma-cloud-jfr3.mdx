## Overview

Prisma Demo servers are Prisma servers running in [Prisma Cloud](https://www.prisma.io/cloud/). **Usage of Demo servers is free of any charge!**

Demo servers are not to be used in production as they are rate-limited and have constraints in terms of storage.

## Limitations

### Rate limiting

Prisma sandboxes are rate limited to **10 requests per 10 seconds** (on average).

If this rate is exceeded, requests are being queued in memory. If the queue exceeds 25 requests, an error is returned immediately. The header field `throttled-by` is included in HTTP responses. It indicates how long the request was delayed due to throttling (in milli seconds).

### Storage

The upper bound in storage capacity for a Prisma service running on a Demo server is **100 MB**.
