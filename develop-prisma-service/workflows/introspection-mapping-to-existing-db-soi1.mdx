## Overview

When connecting Prisma to an existing database that already has a database schema and/or contains some data, it can be tedious to write the data model from scratch while ensuring it matches the structure of the already existing data. 

To automate this process you can use the `prisma introspect` command from the Prisma CLI to generate the [data model](knul) based on the actual structure of the existing data.

The generated SDL serves as a foundation for your Prisma service, but you can easily make modifications afterwards as you see fit. Some common modifications include hiding a table from the GraphQL API or giving a column to a different name.

> WARNING: Currently database introspection only works with Postgres. Additionally there is a set of documented [known limitations](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/issues/2377).

## Introspecting a Postgres database

There are two ways you can use the CLI to introspect a database: 

- Using the interactive `prisma init` wizard
- Using the dedicated `prisma introspect` command

During the prisma init flow you can choose to connect to an existing database with data. The CLI will ask for database connection information and verify that it can establish a successful connection. If the information is correct, the CLI will introspect the database and show you a summary
