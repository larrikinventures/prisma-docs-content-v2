#### Why SDL

The main reason why SDL is used for data modelling is twofold:

- SDL is an **intuitive, simple and concise** way to express type definitions and therefore contributes to a **great developer experience**.
- Using GraphQL SDL to define models that are used as foundation for a GraphQL API is an **idiomatic** approach.

There is no hard technical requirement that would dictate the use of SDL and there might be other ways to provide model definitions in the future.
